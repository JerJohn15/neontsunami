### Introduction
This is the source code for my website/blog [Neon Tsunami](http://www.neontsunami.com). I open sourced it as an example to other developers who might want to see how a real-world Laravel application might be put together. I've worked on a number of large production apps and this is just a taste of my (largely opinionated) style in a smaller app.

If you're interested in seeing how I did things on Laravel 4.2, take a look at the [last commit using 4.2](https://github.com/dwightwatson/neontsunami/tree/85ed06524e834999678ff92bbab520d17ce17889).

### Tests
The tests for this application are written using Laravel's HTTP testing support, as well as Dusk browser testing.

If you're interested in seeing how I did things before the browser testing functionality was introduced, take a look at the [last commit before upgrading to Laravel 5.4](https://github.com/dwightwatson/neontsunami/tree/d56dce716a98a5f412b7ada685856ac67f54cfaf).

If you're interested in seeing how I did things before the integration testing functionality was full-featured, take a look at the [last commit using the older PHPUnit assertion style tests](https://github.com/dwightwatson/neontsunami/tree/9579367eec04773f617523b437b8d73f05abb71d).
